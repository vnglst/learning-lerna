# Learning Lerna

A simple pratical introduction to Lerna.

## Symlinking packages

Clone this repo (make sure you change the package names, e.g. search and replace `vnglst/`). Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Start app:

```sh
yarn start
```

Doesn't work! Packages not found. ðŸ’©

```sh
npx lerna bootstrap
```

Packages are symlinked. If you run `yarn start` now it should work. ðŸŽ‰

## Publishing packages

But what if you want to publish packages? For this your work has to be committed and pushed to a repo (and you have to be logged in to npm). Then you run:

```sh
npx lerna publish
```

Now all the packages that have updates will be published (in this case to npm).

## Testing published packages

However if you now run `yarn start` it will still use the symlinked packages and not the published ones. What if you want to use the actual packages you published on npm? For that you first make a small test change in one of the dependencies, e.g. change 'alpha' to 'alpha2'. Then run:

```sh
npx lerna clean
```

This will remove the symlinked dependencies. Then:

```sh
npx lerna exec yarn
```

This will do a yarn (install) in every package, which means that it will download the packages from npm instead of symlinking.

If, after having tested the actual npm packages, you want to return to the symlinked version you run `npx lerna clean` and then `npx lerna bootstrap` again.

## Publishing updates

If you want to publish updates, you use the same command as before:

```sh
npx lerna publish # note: all changes have to be committed to git
```

Lerna will show you a dialog asking about the upgrade. By default Lerna will upgrade all packages to the same version number (kinda like you see when the React teams does an upgrade of both `React` and `ReactDOM`, those two are always on the exact same version).

So in our case, after this all packages will have `0.0.2` as a version number. As you will notice, Lerna also automatically updates any dependencies that packages might have on each other, so our `usage` package automatically upgrades to use version `0.0.2` of `alpha` and `beta`.

## Independent updates

If you don't want Lerna to automatically update all your packages to the same version number, you can set this in the `lerna.json` config file. Instead of using `version: "0.0.2"` you'd set it to `version: "independent"`.

Now if you make a small change in one of the packages (for instance beta), Lerna will only bump that package's version if you run `lerna publish`.

Note: In this case the version of package `usage` will also be bumped (to `0.0.3`) since that package has a dependency on `beta` and it's `package.json` is automatically updated by Lerna.

## Third party dependencies

Now what about third party depdencies, like for instance `react`? How would you add those as a dependency to your packages -- and keep those up to date? For this Lerna offers the `add` command:

```sh
lerna add react
```

In the default mode this will add `react` as a depdency to **all** packages and installs it in **all** `node_modules` folder. This will lead to a lot of duplicate packages in your monorepo. To avoid this you can set the option hoise to true in your `lerna.json`. Resulting in the following:

```json
{
  "lerna": "",
  "version": "independent",
  "bootstrap": {
    "hoist": true
  }
}
```

With hoist enabled Lerna will symlink the `node_modules` folders of the packages to `node_modules` in the root folder.

## Version management

A common reason to introduce packages in a monorepo is version management. With lerna you can choose to let some parts of your codebase use a different version of a certain package. How does this work with lerna?
